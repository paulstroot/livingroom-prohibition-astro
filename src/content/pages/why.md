    heading: Why build an Astro component starter?
    subtext: >-
      At CloudCannon, we're big fans of the static web. And we love what the
      Astro team is building!


      As more and more <a href="https://cloudcannon.com/partner-program/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">partner agencies</a> are building client
      sites with CloudCannon, we wanted to help out by providing the foundations
      for Astro components that output static HTML and CSS, for the fastest
      delivery possible —&nbsp;all unbranded and adaptable for any project.

              We give you [straightforward building blocks](/component-library/)
              without hiding anything behind layers of abstraction. You see
              everything that's happening, and stay in control.

              Lean HTML, CSS, and small touches of vanilla JavaScript. No dead
              weight, no surprise dependencies, just the pieces you actually
              need to build great pages.

              Performance comes from keeping things lightweight. The framework
              handles image optimization and responsive patterns so your site
              stays quick without extra work.

              Every part of the Component Starter is meant to be opened, read,
              and edited. You shape it to fit your project instead of working
              around someone else's opinions. Start by [browsing the
              components](/component-library/) to see how they're set up!

          This initial slide introduces visitors to the rotating content
          display. You'll notice how the text hierarchy works with the eyebrow,
          headline, and body copy creating clear visual distinction. The
          component is designed to guide users through multiple messages without
          overwhelming the page.

          As you move to the second position, observe how the previous content
          gracefully exits while this new information appears. The navigation
          controls below allow users to move at their own pace. This slide
          exists purely to demonstrate the component's ability to handle
          sequential content delivery.

        description: >-
          By the third slide, the pattern becomes clear. Each rotation maintains
          the same structural hierarchy and spacing, ensuring visual coherence
          throughout the carousel. This consistency helps users understand what
          to expect as they progress through the available content.

        title: Completing the carousel loop
        description: >-
          This fourth and final slide demonstrates how the component handles the
          end of its sequence. Users can either cycle back to the beginning or
          pause here to absorb the information. The carousel has now
          successfully shown its capacity to present multiple content blocks in
          a compact, navigable format.

          I demonstrate how the component handles a third profile entry. My
          carefully crafted placeholder text ensures the layout remains
          consistent, regardless of whether you're viewing on a tablet or
          desktop display.

          I round out the team grid to demonstrate how the layout adapts to a

          sizes.
